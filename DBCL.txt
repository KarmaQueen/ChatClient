Dear Deutsche Bank Talent Acquisition Team,
My name is LEE, Eun Shang, and you can call me David. I finished 3rd year in my undergraduate studies in HKUST for Computer Engineering, and I am currently interning at HSBC as an Industrial Placement Trainee. I came across this position through the DB website. I believe I am the perfect candidate for the Deutsche Bank Technology internship.
	I am currently interning at HSBC in the Commercial Banking IT (CMB IT) department, and my team handles Project Portfolio management in Asia Pacific and IT Transformation. I’m more involved with the IT transformation side. I am the sole developer for a new upcoming project that uses big data to analyze user data and news to let Relationship Managers find potential customers for Commercial Banking. Also, I used VBA to improve and speed up logistics and reduce human error without increasing recurring costs for the business side of CMB.
	I believe I have experience in many different scopes of programming, from “startupy” and trendy frameworks like Node.JS - Javascript to enterprise-level coding in Java. I also have a great sense of design as I have been the lead designer for TEDxHKUST 2016. In addition, through my experience in the International Students Association as the Director of Public Relations, I have learned valuable teamwork and leadership skills.
	Before, I thought that to be good at a technology job, all that was required was to be good at programming. That turned out to be not true at all. Many things are required; not just coding, but also a sense of design, skills to work with a team, and experience is all required to be a fit for success. I am still lacking in a few areas, but I believe I have the most important qualities set to be a great candidate for the Technology – Deutsche Bank Internship Program position.
		
Sincerely,
LEE, Eun Shang (David)
